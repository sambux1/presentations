<!--
Before I begin, I want to lay out the plan for this talk.

I'll start with some background to motivate the problem we're trying to solve.

Then I'll talk about the system we designed to solve the problem

and the specifics of the learning algorithm involved.

Finally, I'll conclude with some lessons learned from the deployment and some areas for future work.
